<div>
    If the change request / pull request is a merge, there are two reasons for a revision change:
    <ul>
        <li>The origin of the change request may have changed</li>
        <li>The target of the change request may have changed</li>
    </ul>
    Selecting this option will ignore revision changes if the only difference between the last built revision
    is the target of the change request.
    <br/>
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> this option only applies if the change request is building a merge of the origin onto the
    target.
